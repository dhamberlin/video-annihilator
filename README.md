# Video Annihilator
Hate autoplaying videos? Use Firefox!

But if you're in Chrome for whatever reason, this extension will delete all video elements on a page with a single click. So you don't have to hunt for a pause button, dodge dodgy practices like hiding the pause button behind a transparent div that unmutes (looking at you, bloomberg.com...), etc.

### Usage
Load using "Load unpacked" from `chrome://extensions/`.
